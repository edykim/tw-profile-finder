## A little background

I love Twitter and I want to find awesome people on Twitter. I can check every single profile, one by one, click over clicks. Yes, it is
so hard to do and I'm lazy on this.

I made this tool from two assumptions at that time. Firstly, awesome people know awesome people. If I can pick one, probably they follow
others. Secondly, I can find people based on servral metrics which Twitter provides such as followers numbers, liked twit count, how many time they
twitted.

This tool allows that find someone filtered by own `function` and chase trees of the following. Also, you can pin a person as a entry point
of search. Hope you find something useful from this tool. âœ¨

## What you can get

The tool generates two files as a result.

- `./reports/<USERNAME>/profiles.html`: Generated report using HTML.
- `./reports/<USERNAME>/profiles.json`: You can play with the data if you like this way.

## What you need 

- NodeJS
- Twitter API (from [Twitter Apps](https://apps.twitter.com/))
